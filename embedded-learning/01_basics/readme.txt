system-info.sh
It is the Hello World of the Linux terminal 
Shell is the C of the Linux Enviroment
Created a small system info script to print the output of the commands neatly

This helps us to understand
1. automation - instead of running 10 different command add all the imp commands system checks to this script and run the script
2. understanding the system enivroment
3. shell scripting is C of Linux Administration
4. similarly we can do a lot 
device-chekc.sh -> to check which sensor is connected /sys/class/i2c-dev
net_diag.sh -> ping check ip
sys_boot_info.sh -> log kernel message to file
and so on and so forth.....
