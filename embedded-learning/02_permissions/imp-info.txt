file permission 
created a secret.txt ran a ls -l command and saw this 

-rw-rw-rw- 1 codespace codespace 29 Oct 18 10:05 secret.txt
lets understand this 
- -> indicates this is file
rw- -> owner
rw- -> group
rw- -> other
1 -> link count
codespace codespace -> owner and group names
29 Oct 18 10:05 -> Modification time
secret.txt -> file name

we can change the permission of this file using chmod (change mod) command

before running a script we have to make it excutable so we use
chmod +x test.sh and if you do the ls -l to check the permission
now instead of rw- it will be rwx and you manually choose who can do what with the file only read or only write or only read execute and so on..

eg 
chmod 600 secret.txt -> means only i(owner) can read write the file
chmod 644 secret.txt -> owner can read/write and group and other can only read 

lets understand how just the decimal can change the permission
we have 3 permission rwx (read write execute)
Operation	rwx	   	Value
Read		100 (r--)	 4
Write		010 (-w-)	 2
Execute		001 (--x)	 1
All		111 (rwx)	 7	

chmod 600 means owner has 6 (read + write) group and other has 0 (no access)
chmod 644 means owner has 6 (read + write) group and otehr has 4 (only read)

never give chmod 777 it will all the access of the file to everyone !!
